# Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)

Deep Learning (AI) + Deep Thinking (Physics) = Deeper Understanding

The [NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions](https://iaifi.org) (IAIFI, pronounced /aɪ-faɪ/) is one of the inaugural NSF AI research institutes. The IAIFI is advancing physics knowledge – from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe – and galvanizing AI research innovation. The IAIFI is a collaboration of both physics and AI researchers at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts. By combining state-of-the-art research with early career talent and a growing AI + physics community in the Boston area and beyond, the IAIFI is enabling researchers to develop AI technologies to tackle some of the most challenging problems in physics, and transfer these technologies to the broader AI community.
